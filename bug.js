This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when component state changes unexpectedly. For example, if you fetch data from an API and try to render it before it's loaded, you'll get this error when trying to access properties of the data object because the data will be `null` or `undefined` initially.  Another scenario is when a component's state is updated asynchronously; if you try to access properties from the state before the update completes, you may encounter this error.
